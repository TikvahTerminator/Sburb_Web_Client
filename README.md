#SBURB Web Client
####An emulation of the SBURB Game from Homestuck in Browser.


This is an early version of a SBURB simulator. It has basic functions currently like:

- UI interface
- Interactive Client Connection UI (More features possibly to be added?)
- Volume Control
- "Alpha Mode"
- SBURB Loading screen for the Nostalgia^tm

I was meant to finish and release this months ago but i'll probably revisit it at some other point

Until then i'm releasing it so people who want to cosplay with it (if it works on your pc lol) can.

Currently it only works on **Firefox** and ironically I think **Microsoft Edge** actually manages it as well.

Chrome doesn't like it because Chrome likes be special with it's autoplay function. So until i, or anyone else who wants to commit or fork this figures that out... i dont think chrome will work.

Anyway...

## How to use

Download the release, extract, and click on "index.html".  It should just load for you.

It will probably look skewed cause Jquery didn't like my way of trying to determine browser size if i remember.  So if anything like that happens, take a screenshot and let me know.

Anyway.   Enjoy!
